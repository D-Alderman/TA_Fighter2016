***************************************************************************
In this game, a single student will rise above and become the best TA in the COP3503 class, 
by battling the current TAs. The interface is simple, and driven by user input. For testing purposes, please
try to put incorrect input, as it should all be accounted for through a validation process. 
If invalid input is allowed to go through, please alert me so I can make corrections.

In order to run this game, you need to save all the files, build the project and run through the 
TA_Fighter2016.cpp file. 

I honestly am not sure if it is possible to beat the boss, or the two hidden bosses...but maybe 
you will get luckier than I did =).
I constantly edited their stats and abilities to make it slightly easier to beat them, but they 
should still provide an adequate challenge. 

I had a ton of fun making this, and am going to try to make it a full length game using Unity with a 
coworker of mine. So if you do find any errors that I missed while testing, please feel free to email me
so that I can correct it for the full length project.
